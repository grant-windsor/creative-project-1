      <p> Listen my friends, and let me tell you of the time I was lost in the woods with only some chicken breasts, some oil and spices, and portable stove.
      I was famished and it was getting dark. I decided to camp for the night. I cooked my chicken using a recipe my mom had taught me in happier times.</p>
      <p>As I cooked, I became aware of a mysterious presence behind me. I turned and found myself face to face with the lonely man of winter. He was dressed
      in ragged clothes and had a long white beard. He just stood there in the snow, staring at me with eyes like deep pools of molasses.</p>
      <p>Finally I found my voice and told him I was lost. He stood there, looking at me for a long time. Finally he pointed at the chicken I was cooking. Did he want some? I offered a piece
      to him, which he immediately took and ate. I gave him some more and soon my chicken was all gone. After he had eaten, he wiped his mouth on his sleeve and pointed into the sky.
      It took me a while to see what he was pointing at, but I eventually saw that he was pointing at a bright star, which had appeared in the dimming light.
      I asked him what he meant. In a strange rough voice he told me "You go, follow the star". Then he just left, disapearing into the night like a ghost. I
      stood awestruck for a moment, and then decided to take he old man's advice. I followed the star and soon saw the lights of a highway. I was saved.</p>
      <p>This is the chicken I cooked for the old man:</p>
      <div class="instr">

        <ul>
          <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
          <li>Olive Oil</li>
          <li>Spices (pretty much any kind as far as I can tell)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 350</p></li>
        <li><p>Defrost chicken in the microwave for a couple minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Rub olive oil and spices onto the chicken breasts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the chicken breasts on a pan and cook them for about 20 minutes. </p></li>
         <li><p>When the inside is no longer pink and has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees, they are done. Let them cool for 10 minutes before eating.</p></li>
      </ol>
